    <strong>
        Why am I getting an “Authorization Error” when I open the app?
    </strong>
    <br/>
    You will need to disable the two-factor authentication when this message
    appears. You will need to disable it in settings/privacy and
    security/two-factor authentication. You can only do this on your desktop
    computer. More info can be found here:

    <strong>
        Why am I getting an error when I try to unfollow someone?
        <br/>
    </strong>
    If you try to follow, unfollow, like, or comment too fast, Instagram can
    trigger your account as a spam account. Try doing these actions (follow,
    unfollow, like, or comment )at a steady pace throughout the day. The newer
    your account, the higher chance your account will be triggered as a spam
    account when trying to complete these actions (follow, unfollow, like, or
    comment) too fast. When your account is labeled as a spam, you will have a
    set limit to follow, unfollow, like or comment per day. Your account can
    also be triggered as spam if you are using a proxy that is labeled as spam
    by Instagram. If these problems occur, don’t follow, unfollow, like, or
    comment for 12-24 hours and this problem will go away.
    <br/>

<p>
    3. <strong>What is the safe number to unfollow people per hour?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This answer will vary depending on the age of your account. A safe number
    to unfollow per hour is 50. But again, it may vary depending on the age of
    your account.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>4. </strong>
    <strong>Why is this app taking so long to load? </strong>
</p>
<p>
    If you have a big Instagram account (20k+ Followers 7.5K Following) this
    app might not load properly. If you are using an older Android device, this
    problem will occur too.
    <br/>

<p>
    <strong>5. </strong>
    <strong>Why are there so many ads?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In exchange for keeping this app free for use, we put ads to compensate it.

    6. <strong>Will there be a premium version for Instunfollow App?</strong>
    <br/>
    Yes there will be a premium version of this app in the future. The app will
    contain NO Ads and will have many cool features. If you really this app,
    please don’t forget to rate it.

    <strong>
        How do I login into this app if I use Facebook to login into my
        Instagram?
        <br/>
    </strong>
    We suggest you login into your Instagram account and then set your
    password. You can do it here:
    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/accounts/password/change/">

        <br/>

    Instunfollow for free. You can unfollow an additional 200 Non-followers with our
    reward program. Each day we give out 8 tokens. With each token, you can use
    it to unfollow 50 Non-followers. You can earn tokens by simply watching

    <strong>
        I can Unfollow people manually on Instagram, why do I need to use this
        app?
        <br/>
    </strong>
    Our app can help you unfollow people faster and you will only unfollow
    people who don’t follow you on Instagram. Our app will also keep track on    <a name="_GoBack"></a> the number of people you unfollowed in 24 hours.
